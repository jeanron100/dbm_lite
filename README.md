# dbm_lite
This project meant to provide useful scripts for DB maintance and management, to make work easier and interesting...
Till now, it includes only scripts for Oracle, which I used for years,share it with you, and will continue to add more...or even MySQL
Most of scripts are tested in Linux and part of Unix(Solaris,AIX,HP-UX),but not completely tested,sorry not tested in Windows yet.

How to Start
